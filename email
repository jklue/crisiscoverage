email

Hi Michael,

Thanks for the email. This is a good mid-week check-in.

Just to clarify, let me try to describe the data column headers with descriptions:

Domain(is this a url?), title of article, date article published, collection(name of crisis, eg. Haiyan), tags ('traditional' or 'social' media), url of article, clean text of article.

I have no good reason, but I'd rather go with Google too as it seems like the more widely used search mechanism. This still leaves us with little 'social' sources, but maybe we could narrow our scope to media coverage in general of a crisis.

As far as what I'd like to accomplish: I'd like to have the basic timeline visualization implemented with one sample data source (not including the story highlights or the wordcloud). I'm currently building the three main pages of our site (overview, timeline, and data).

I have to work this Saturday. Would Sunday be possible again? Sorry about that.

Thanks,
Luke
