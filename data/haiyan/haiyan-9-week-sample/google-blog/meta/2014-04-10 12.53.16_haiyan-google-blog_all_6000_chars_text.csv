Three months on, despite a huge national and international effort, humanitarian need across affected areas remains enormous. What Oxfam is doing Oxfam is working on the islands of Cebu, Leyte and Samar. We have reached almost 550,000 people with emergency relief during the first three months of the response. This includes supplying clean water to more than 200,000 people in Tacloban by supporting the government to repair and fix broken pipes. We have provided people with hygiene kits, sanitation services, cash support, water kits, rice seed, shelter materials, kits for pregnant women, hygiene education and cleaned waste and debris. We are also helping to prevent diseases, such as dengue and malaria spreading, in cooperation with the Department of Health in Tacloban. We are supporting fisherfolk and coconut farmers, particularly women, whose means of earning a living have been decimated by the typhoon and we are poised to provide start-up capital for small businesses, as well as equipment such as fishing nets and kits, seeds and fertiliser. We believe that, now is the time to focus on bolstering longer-term support to boost income so people no longer need to rely on emergency aid.

Read the blog: The art of saying &quot;Thank you&quot; The situation Super typhoon Haiyan (locally Yolanda) is another deadly warning of what much of the world can expect unless we can minimize climate change. Around 14 million people have been affected, some 6,000 killed, and an estimated 4.4 million displaced. Despite the massive logistical challenges and widespread destruction, the relief effort has helped millions to survive. Major gaps remain, however, especially in rural and hard to reach areas. Like most disasters, typhoon Haiyan has hit the poorest and the most vulnerable people the hardest. 4 out of 10 families in the affected provinces were living below the poverty line before Haiyan hit. Many families lived from small-scale agriculture, fishing and from low paid jobs and micro-enterprises in towns and cities. The typhoon affected a third of the country&apos;s rice growing areas and missing the current planting season will potentially leave millions of people without their staple food. Longer-term support is needed to help communities build back better and protect people against future shocks. The Reconstruction Assistance on Yolanda (RAY) plan issued by the Philippines government on 18 December outlines many positive principles and intentions. However, it lacks a bold vision for significantly tackling poverty and inequality. Justin Morgan, our Country Director in the Philippines, said: “It’s been immensely challenging to get aid through, but the response, both from the people of the Philippines and the international community, has been amazing. &quot;Our main concern now is supporting rural communities who have not received anything like adequate assistance yet and making sure people are able to quickly rebuild their homes, infrastructure and livelihoods, in a way that will make them more resilient to future shocks. “Typhoon Haiyan is the shape of things to come - with climate change set to increase the severity of typhoons in the region and projected sea level rises to compound the effects of deadly storm surge.

People are now starting to build or repair homes. Wikimedia Commons under a Creative Commons Licence The foul odour and sight of the piles of debris that littered the side of the road caused the chatter in the car to fall eerily silent as we made our way through the devastation from Western to Eastern Samar in the Philippines. It was six days after Typhoon Haiyan struck. When I first saw the destruction my heart broke – I couldn’t comprehend what I was seeing. The storm – one of the worst on record – had ravished my homeland and killed over 5000. People were silent, motionless. But the pain was etched on their faces, clear for all to see. I travelled to Guiuan, Eastern Samar, which bore the brunt of the 8 November storm. Winds of up to 305 km per hour had torn homes and lives to shreds. The region was one of the poorest in the country even before Haiyan hit. Around 60 per cent of the population live in poverty and – many rely on coconut farming and fishing to earn enough to make ends meet. Yet as the waves, some higher than the coconut trees, swept in from the sea, they tore fishing boats and trees to shreds, leaving thousands without livelihoods. A total of 5.9 million people in the Philippines have seen their sources of income lost or disrupted, according to the UN. But although many had lost loved ones and their homes were reduced to rubble, their sheer determination to bounce back and get on with it, using whatever resources they can, was remarkable even then. It has now been three months since Haiyan. Homes are slowly being repaired with donated tools and materials, such as tarpaulin sheets and ropes. Debris has been cleared, leaving roads more accessible. Most communities have essential goods like jerry cans, tarpaulin sheets and blankets, and in some areas close to commercial centres, people are starting to get back to normality as small shops pop up selling much needed foods such as rice and canned meats.There is still a long way to go. The majority of those who live in Eastern Samar don’t have the money, or the means to earn enough to buy enough food to feed their families. The price of goods is high and volatile making the situation worse for many of the poor and vulnerable. Although people want to be self-reliant, it’s not possible yet, and many remain dependent on food distributions. Healthcare remains a concern for roughly a third of the population; sexual violence is on the rise. For these communities living at the end of dirt tracks, many kilometres from the nearest town or city, it will be a long time before their lives resemble those of before. In the immediate aftermath, the organization I work for – Coastal Core, a partner of Christian Aid – supplied communities with food and other items. Now it is starting to support communities through cash-for-work schemes, giving people the opportunity to help the clear up and rebuilding process by preparing felled coconut trees to make timber for shelter repairs. It also hands out grants to allow people to repair or restart their occupations. This will, in turn, provide them with the means to buy food for their families and materials to mend their homes. Other priority areas now include supporting fishing communities to repair their boats, introducing community gardening for growing vegetables, and restoring vital services that so many of us take for granted, such as clean water supplies. Wounds are not yet healed, homes remain in the coastal danger zone, and the means for local people to make a living are still very limited. Much more needs to be done to support communities to fully recover. In the long term, people will face frequent typhoons, flooding and erratic weather patterns. Learning more about climate change, how to build homes that are more likely to withstand storms, and what to do in emergency situations – especially in the more remote areas – are all ways to help guard against the challenges ahead. In the meantime, we will continue to give people the tools they need to re-build their lives and communities. Maila Quiring is a project officer with Coastal CORE, which is funded by Christian Aid. She works with communities in Samar to help them prepare for disasters and adapt to a changing climate.

Tropical Depression Lingling—locally known in the Philippines as Agaton—damaged shelters and crops in areas affected by Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan. To date, the Shelter Cluster has provided close to 500,000 households with emergency shelter assistance, such as tents and plastic sheeting. More than 55,000 households have received tools and materials enabling them to repair their own homes safely. The Philippines is the world&apos;s second-largest coconut producer, accounting for more than 25 percent of global production in 2013. Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan damaged or destroyed an estimated 33 million coconut trees, affecting the livelihoods of more than one million coconut farmers.

It’s really important to remain focused on our efforts going forward. I was in Tacloban a few weeks ago, and I was able to see the immediate impacts of a long-term partnership with the Government of the Philippines. I was able to see the impact of our initial investments over the last five years in building up their capacity to mitigate the effects of these large natural disasters. I also was able to see how we’ve been working very strongly with diaspora groups, NGOs, local groups and the private sector to build the long-term relationships that we were able to put into action on day one.

It’s really important to remain focused on our efforts going forward. I was in Tacloban a few weeks ago, and I was able to see the immediate impacts of a long-term partnership with the Government of the Philippines. I was able to see the impact of our initial investments over the last five years in building up their capacity to mitigate the effects of these large natural disasters. I also was able to see how we’ve been working very strongly with diaspora groups, NGOs, local groups and the private sector to build the long-term relationships that we were able to put into action on day one.

I was in Tacloban a few weeks ago, and I was able to see the immediate impacts of a long-term partnership with the Government of the Philippines. I was able to see the impact of our initial investments over the last five years in building up their capacity to mitigate the effects of these large natural disasters. I also was able to see how we’ve been working very strongly with diaspora groups, NGOs, local groups and the private sector to build the long-term relationships that we were able to put into action on day one.

(© Conservation International/photo by Lynn Tang) It is with a heavy heart I have gone about my business at the climate negotiations in Warsaw each day knowing that about 12 million people are affected by the recent devastating Typhoon Haiyan, known locally as Yolanda. Historic in its scope, meteorologists, including experts from NASA, concluded that it is the most destructive and powerful tropical cyclone to ever make landfall (it made a total of six landfalls). It is hard to imagine that such an intense storm (stronger than Katrina or Sandy) would not leave death and destruction in its path, even with the best preparations in place. Despite the pre-emptive evacuations, Haiyan’s devastation claimed thousands of lives. According to the U.N., the current death toll is 4,460. About 12,501 are injured and 1,186 still missing according to the Philippine disaster council. About 3 million people have been displaced, with about 400,000 living in more than 1,186 evacuation centers. The images on TV are heartbreaking and the stories of death and destruction brought chills and intense emotions. I, like Filipinos and people around the world, am heartbroken at the images and stories from survivors of this horrifying event. A mother being told by her daughter to let go and save herself. A child walking aimlessly after losing her entire family.  A father unable to save his family. A picture of a family huddled together in death and stories about death in evacuation centers. In many islands, villages and municipalities, more than 90% of homes and infrastructure were destroyed and people have nothing left to go back to. These are not just stories. These are grim and shocking realities. Hearts the world over go out to the Philippines.  We see an outpouring of support and sympathy, from government aid to kids donating their pocket money and selling lemonade and cupcakes for the victims. Everyone is talking about what has happened — Typhoon Haiyan has opened the eyes of the world to the impacts of climate change. We ask ourselves if our experience is the new norm. Since 2009, the Philippines has experienced 17 of history’s worst typhoons in terms of casualties. The Philippines has been reeling from disasters one after another. Last October, Bohol Island in central Philippines was devastated by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake and now by Haiyan: a double whammy. According to the United Nations report, the Philippines ranks as the nation third-most at-risk from climate change in the world, ranked behind the South Pacific island nations of Vanuatu and Tonga. Similarly, the Germanwatch 2014 Vulnerability Index ranked the Philippines second for weather related losses in 2012. While our country is very vulnerable to natural calamities or disasters, many of my colleagues in the Climate Commission and in civil society find it difficult not to relate the Haiyan tragedy to the climate change debate and how it impacts ecosystems, human communities, livelihoods and eventually the well-being of Filipinos. Let me share with you a story of hope in the midst of this tragedy. Oriental Mindoro Province is located in the Verde Island Passage and is part of the Sulu Sulawesi Seascape. Although it was not the region worst hit by the super typhoon, it was nonetheless gravely affected.  No casualties were reported in the Province according to Governor Umali, a long time partner of CI-Philippines. Plans were in place and they did their pre-emptive evacuation even before the storm struck. In our community project site in Oriental Mindoro, our community partners also did their share of pre-emptive evacuation. CI-Philippines works with partners to find solutions to reduce the risks of climate change by promoting ecosystems based approaches to adaptation and demonstrating the importance of natural systems to help coastal communities protect life and property and adapt to rising sea levels and storms. Rehabilitation of mangrove areas in the Verde Island Passage is one important adaptation solution coupled with disaster management planning.

(© Conservation International/photo by Lynn Tang) It is with a heavy heart I have gone about my business at the climate negotiations in Warsaw each day knowing that about 12 million people are affected by the recent devastating Typhoon Haiyan, known locally as Yolanda. Historic in its scope, meteorologists, including experts from NASA, concluded that it is the most destructive and powerful tropical cyclone to ever make landfall (it made a total of six landfalls). It is hard to imagine that such an intense storm (stronger than Katrina or Sandy) would not leave death and destruction in its path, even with the best preparations in place. Despite the pre-emptive evacuations, Haiyan’s devastation claimed thousands of lives. According to the U.N., the current death toll is 4,460. About 12,501 are injured and 1,186 still missing according to the Philippine disaster council. About 3 million people have been displaced, with about 400,000 living in more than 1,186 evacuation centers. The images on TV are heartbreaking and the stories of death and destruction brought chills and intense emotions. I, like Filipinos and people around the world, am heartbroken at the images and stories from survivors of this horrifying event. A mother being told by her daughter to let go and save herself. A child walking aimlessly after losing her entire family.  A father unable to save his family. A picture of a family huddled together in death and stories about death in evacuation centers. In many islands, villages and municipalities, more than 90% of homes and infrastructure were destroyed and people have nothing left to go back to. These are not just stories. These are grim and shocking realities. Hearts the world over go out to the Philippines.  We see an outpouring of support and sympathy, from government aid to kids donating their pocket money and selling lemonade and cupcakes for the victims. Everyone is talking about what has happened — Typhoon Haiyan has opened the eyes of the world to the impacts of climate change. We ask ourselves if our experience is the new norm. Since 2009, the Philippines has experienced 17 of history’s worst typhoons in terms of casualties. The Philippines has been reeling from disasters one after another. Last October, Bohol Island in central Philippines was devastated by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake and now by Haiyan: a double whammy. According to the United Nations report, the Philippines ranks as the nation third-most at-risk from climate change in the world, ranked behind the South Pacific island nations of Vanuatu and Tonga. Similarly, the Germanwatch 2014 Vulnerability Index ranked the Philippines second for weather related losses in 2012. While our country is very vulnerable to natural calamities or disasters, many of my colleagues in the Climate Commission and in civil society find it difficult not to relate the Haiyan tragedy to the climate change debate and how it impacts ecosystems, human communities, livelihoods and eventually the well-being of Filipinos. Let me share with you a story of hope in the midst of this tragedy. Oriental Mindoro Province is located in the Verde Island Passage and is part of the Sulu Sulawesi Seascape. Although it was not the region worst hit by the super typhoon, it was nonetheless gravely affected.  No casualties were reported in the Province according to Governor Umali, a long time partner of CI-Philippines. Plans were in place and they did their pre-emptive evacuation even before the storm struck. In our community project site in Oriental Mindoro, our community partners also did their share of pre-emptive evacuation. CI-Philippines works with partners to find solutions to reduce the risks of climate change by promoting ecosystems based approaches to adaptation and demonstrating the importance of natural systems to help coastal communities protect life and property and adapt to rising sea levels and storms. Rehabilitation of mangrove areas in the Verde Island Passage is one important adaptation solution coupled with disaster management planning. In areas where Typhoon Haiyan passed through in Northern Samar, villagers credit that mangrove restoration with saving lives and their economy. Not everywhere was so fortunate. On Camotes Island, for example, all 500 houses were de[...]"

Since 2009, the Philippines has experienced 17 of history’s worst typhoons in terms of casualties. The Philippines has been reeling from disasters one after another. Last October, Bohol Island in central Philippines was devastated by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake and now by Haiyan: a double whammy. According to the United Nations report, the Philippines ranks as the nation third-most at-risk from climate change in the world, ranked behind the South Pacific island nations of Vanuatu and Tonga. Similarly, the Germanwatch 2014 Vulnerability Index ranked the Philippines second for weather related losses in 2012. While our country is very vulnerable to natural calamities or disasters, many of my colleagues in the Climate Commission and in civil society find it difficult not to relate the Haiyan tragedy to the climate change debate and how it impacts ecosystems, human communities, livelihoods and eventually the well-being of Filipinos. Let me share with you a story of hope in the midst of this tragedy. Oriental Mindoro Province is located in the Verde Island Passage and is part of the Sulu Sulawesi Seascape. Although it was not the region worst hit by the super typhoon, it was nonetheless gravely affected.  No casualties were reported in the Province according to Governor Umali, a long time partner of CI-Philippines. Plans were in place and they did their pre-emptive evacuation even before the storm struck. In our community project site in Oriental Mindoro, our community partners also did their share of pre-emptive evacuation. CI-Philippines works with partners to find solutions to reduce the risks of climate change by promoting ecosystems based approaches to adaptation and demonstrating the importance of natural systems to help coastal communities protect life and property and adapt to rising sea levels and storms. Rehabilitation of mangrove areas in the Verde Island Passage is one important adaptation solution coupled with disaster management planning. In areas where Typhoon Haiyan passed through in Northern Samar, villagers credit that mangrove restoration with saving lives and their economy. Not everywhere was so fortunate. On Camotes Island, for example, all 500 houses were de[...]"

(© Conservation International/photo by Lynn Tang) It is with a heavy heart I have gone about my business at the climate negotiations in Warsaw each day knowing that about 12 million people are affected by the recent devastating Typhoon Haiyan, known locally as Yolanda. Historic in its scope, meteorologists, including experts from NASA, concluded that it is the most destructive and powerful tropical cyclone to ever make landfall (it made a total of six landfalls). It is hard to imagine that such an intense storm (stronger than Katrina or Sandy) would not leave death and destruction in its path, even with the best preparations in place. Despite the pre-emptive evacuations, Haiyan’s devastation claimed thousands of lives. According to the U.N., the current death toll is 4,460. About 12,501 are injured and 1,186 still missing according to the Philippine disaster council. About 3 million people have been displaced, with about 400,000 living in more than 1,186 evacuation centers. The images on TV are heartbreaking and the stories of death and destruction brought chills and intense emotions. I, like Filipinos and people around the world, am heartbroken at the images and stories from survivors of this horrifying event. A mother being told by her daughter to let go and save herself. A child walking aimlessly after losing her entire family.  A father unable to save his family. A picture of a family huddled together in death and stories about death in evacuation centers. In many islands, villages and municipalities, more than 90% of homes and infrastructure were destroyed and people have nothing left to go back to. These are not just stories. These are grim and shocking realities. Hearts the world over go out to the Philippines.  We see an outpouring of support and sympathy, from government aid to kids donating their pocket money and selling lemonade and cupcakes for the victims. Everyone is talking about what has happened — Typhoon Haiyan has opened the eyes of the world to the impacts of climate change. We ask ourselves if our experience is the new norm.

It is hard to imagine that such an intense storm (stronger than Katrina or Sandy) would not leave death and destruction in its path, even with the best preparations in place. Despite the pre-emptive evacuations, Haiyan’s devastation claimed thousands of lives. According to the U.N., the current death toll is 4,460. About 12,501 are injured and 1,186 still missing according to the Philippine disaster council. About 3 million people have been displaced, with about 400,000 living in more than 1,186 evacuation centers. The images on TV are heartbreaking and the stories of death and destruction brought chills and intense emotions. I, like Filipinos and people around the world, am heartbroken at the images and stories from survivors of this horrifying event. A mother being told by her daughter to let go and save herself. A child walking aimlessly after losing her entire family.  A father unable to save his family. A picture of a family huddled together in death and stories about death in evacuation centers. In many islands, villages and municipalities, more than 90% of homes and infrastructure were destroyed and people have nothing left to go back to. These are not just stories. These are grim and shocking realities. Hearts the world over go out to the Philippines.  We see an outpouring of support and sympathy, from government aid to kids donating their pocket money and selling lemonade and cupcakes for the victims. Everyone is talking about what has happened — Typhoon Haiyan has opened the eyes of the world to the impacts of climate change. We ask ourselves if our experience is the new norm. Since 2009, the Philippines has experienced 17 of history’s worst typhoons in terms of casualties. The Philippines has been reeling from disasters one after another. Last October, Bohol Island in central Philippines was devastated by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake and now by Haiyan: a double whammy. According to the United Nations report, the Philippines ranks as the nation third-most at-risk from climate change in the world, ranked behind the South Pacific island nations of Vanuatu and Tonga. Similarly, the Germanwatch 2014 Vulnerability Index ranked the Philippines second for weather related losses in 2012. While our country is very vulnerable to natural calamities or disasters, many of my colleagues in the Climate Commission and in civil society find it difficult not to relate the Haiyan tragedy to the climate change debate and how it impacts ecosystems, human communities, livelihoods and eventually the well-being of Filipinos. Let me share with you a story of hope in the midst of this tragedy. Oriental Mindoro Province is located in the Verde Island Passage and is part of the Sulu Sulawesi Seascape. Although it was not the region worst hit by the super typhoon, it was nonetheless gravely affected.  No casualties were reported in the Province according to Governor Umali, a long time partner of CI-Philippines. Plans were in place and they did their pre-emptive evacuation even before the storm struck. In our community project site in Oriental Mindoro, our community partners also did their share of pre-emptive evacuation. CI-Philippines works with partners to find solutions to reduce the risks of climate change by promoting ecosystems based approaches to adaptation and demonstrating the importance of natural systems to help coastal communities protect life and property and adapt to rising sea levels and storms. Rehabilitation of mangrove areas in the Verde Island Passage is one important adaptation solution coupled with disaster management planning. In areas where Typhoon Haiyan passed through in Northern Samar, villagers credit that mangrove restoration with saving lives and their economy. Not everywhere was so fortunate. On Camotes Island, for example, all 500 houses were de[...]"
