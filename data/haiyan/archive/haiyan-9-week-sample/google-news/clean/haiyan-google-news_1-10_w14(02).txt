Photo: Jarkko Mikkonen/Finnish Red Cross When responding overseas, the American Red Cross works closely with the affected Red Cross society to provide the level of staff support and assistance requested. Posted March 05, 2014 , Updated article Nearly four months on, the global Red Cross network continues to help families rebuild and rebound from Typhoon Haiyan—a storm that tore through the Philippines with record strength winds and high storm surges. Approximately 16 million people across 40 provinces were affected by Typhoon Haiyan and more than 1 million homes damaged or destroyed. Red Cross volunteers have been caring for people even before Typhoon Haiyan made landfall. Prior to the arrival of the storm, the Philippine Red Cross worked closely with local disaster authorities to support preemptive evacuations, helping move more than 125,000 families to safer shelters. The Philippine Red Cross also disseminated early warning messages and safety tips in areas along the path of the typhoon. When the storm made landfall, the global Red Cross network assisted survivors by delivering food, mosquito nets, medical care and other vital assistance to people in need. Despite blocked roads, destroyed infrastructure, and downed communication lines, the Red Cross was able to get water to more than 710,000 people in the first month and provided vital medical care—delivering 100 babies at a field hospital in Ormoc in its first 10 days. AMERICAN RED CROSS RESPONSE EFFORTS The American Red Cross has played a major role in helping support the global response by lending people, expertise and equipment to the massive effort. The American Red Cross has spent or committed $28 million and deployed 43 disaster specialists to the Philippines, thus far. Its disaster specialists have provided a wide range of support for sheltering activities and relief distribution, as well as technical expertise in mapping, telecommunications and information technology. With financial and technical support from the American Red Cross, the global Red Cross network has distributed cash grants to more than 57,000 families affected by the typhoon. These grants are empowering families to make their own decisions about how to rebuild. “Cash gives people the ability to decide what’s important to them and their family,” said Tracy Reines, head of the American Red Cross’s International Response Operations Center. “It’s efficient. It’s fast. And it’s dignified.” In past disasters, people have used cash to purchase items to meet pressing needs like seeds, school uniforms, bicycle parts and mattresses. The Red Cross has provided cash during previous emergencies, but this is the largest and most ambitious cash transfer effort yet. Houses, crops, the water supply and people’s livelihoods remain damaged, or in many cases, completely destroyed. For example, coconuts trees—a major cash crop in the local economy— were broken in half, meaning years of lost income or farmers. The global Red Cross network will remain active as people overcome these challenges and work to rebuild their lives. 7 Ways the Red Cross is Helpinig People after Typhoon Haiyan Tags: Philippines, Haiyan, Typhoon.

Philippines Coconut Industry Struggles to Recover after Typhon Haiyan Tweet Related Articles  Search for the Missing Continues in Tacloban, Philippines TEXT SIZE - + Jason Strother / Malte Kollenberg March 07, 2014 TACLOBAN, PHILIPPINES — Last December, Typhoon Haiyan&apos;s destructive winds devastated the Philippines. Parts of the archipelago nation are still recovering. Among those hardest hit were farmers, nearly half of whom harvest coconuts. In Leyte province, efforts to revitalize the coconut farming industry are underway.   Before the storm, farmers at a farm in rural Leyte harvested the dried meat, or copra, of coconuts to make oil, but Typhoon Haiyan’s destruction has made the future of this and many other small plantations unclear.   The farm’s caretaker, Arnulflo Barcero, 52, said the typhoon knocked out the large majority of the farm&apos;s trees.   “Before the typhoon we had 700 trees and now there are only 90 trees still standing. It’s a problem for the community because we rely on the copras to earn a living,” said Barcero.   Around 40 percent of farmers in Leyte province work in the coconut industry.  The downed trees mean they have nothing to sell and the help they employ have no work. But for others, the devastation is creating income.   Francisco Alverca, a chainsaw operator who has been called in to help cut up the fallen and damaged trees, is one of those benefiting.    “I think it will take several months to complete all the work here, it is a big property,” said Alverca.   Alverca and other chainsaw operators are employed in the many sawmills around Leyte province. International aid groups hire them and train local farmers to use saws to clear the land of dead trees so new ones can be planted. Now, coconut lumber is in high demand.   The wood is transported from the ruined farms to the city of Tacloban to build shelters for those displaced by the typhoon.   Around 100 families in the town of Palo are rebuilding their own homes with the freshly cut lumber.     Rice farmer Rudolfo Palamos, 74, had his entire house ripped apart by Haiyan’s strong winds.   “This area has a lot of coconut trees. The wood isn’t so expensive and it’s easy to build with.  Most of my house was rebuilt with the coconut tree lumber, including the walls, the corner posts,” said Palamos.   There are many more fallen trees back in the plantations. But there is concern that time is running out to cut them up.   Caroline Gluck, with OXFAM, an aid group that oversees six sawmill programs in Leyte province, said time is of the essence.   “In three months the likelihood is that many of these trees will rot and become infested with pests. And those pests can eat some of the still standing and productive trees,” said Gluck.   Once the downed trees are cleared, aid groups can start helping coconut farmers replant on their land, but it could take several more years before new trees are ready for harvest.
