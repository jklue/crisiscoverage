## Streamcast Outline
### CONCEPT
1. The orientation narration will generally follow the martini text flow as we discussed BUT the screencast will use the actual live pages not the martini pages (eventually clips from the screencast will become the actual martini backdrop gifs).  
2. We are also supposed to transition to interesting findings and conclusions, which I have slipped into the overview, using our two `Crises Compared` tabs as the basis of our findings.  

Given the importance of the screencast on both the need for impact and the grade implications under a 2 minute restriction, I recommend NOT doing this as a single recording but rather scripted from each section, doing some dry runs until the scene is solid, kind of like the movies. What follows is my input to a script starting point, though you guys will certainly want to embellish to meet recording needs.

## Intro (~:15)
WHERE? [`Homepage` with globe spinning]  
NARRATION  
>* How much does the media provide crisis coverage? 
* Where is the coverage coming from? 
* And, what are the key story points that shape a crisis?

>These are a few of the questions that drove us to establish Crisis Coverage where you are invited to explore various crises from `Drought in Pakistan` to `Typhoon Haiyan` to `Revolt in Turkey` to `Protests in Ukraine`. 

## World (3 tabs ~:30, ends NLT :45)
WHERE? [on `World` page]  
NARRATION  
>We begin our a brief overview of the site from the `World` page which gives several visualizations related to geographic crisis engagement. 
* The `Compared Crises` Tab provides a sankey diagram of all countries that provided top-ten results for each of the crises assessed by amount of coverage emanating from a country. `FINDING #1 -->` We found that consistently interested countries include the US, UK, India, and Canada. Single crisis countries include Philippines, Ukraine, Malaysia, South Africa, and Kenya. Prominent countries like Australia, France and Italy are consistently interested, even when outside the top-ten -- see other Tabs for full results.  
* The `Map` Tab presents results by country, colored on a choropleth map according to level of response. It is useful to gauge general responses to a single crisis at a glance.  
* And, the `Bar Chart` Tab presents results by country provided as a horizontal bar chart according to level of response. It is useful to compare the level of response for a single crisis in absolute or numerical terms.  

## Timeline (3 tabs ~ :45, ends NLT 1:30)
WHERE? [on `Timeline` page]  
NARRATION  
>Next, we look at the `Timeline` page which offers insights into media responses over the lifespan of a crisis. As many of the crises we have chosen are ongoing, the response lengths will vary according to the information available.
* The `Compared Crises` Tab provides a line chart reflecting the percentage of change in crisis coverage can be compared from month to month to determine increased, same, or decreased media attention aggregated across ___all___ Google results. `FINDING #2 -->` We found that the only crisis to have a resurgence in coverage was (Typhoon) `Haiyan` which had a 19% increase in coverage from month `2` to month `3`. Also noteworthy was `Turkish Revolt` where coverage stayed the same between months `3` and `4`. All other months of coverage declined. It would be worth further exploring possible reasons for the changes.
* The `Type Tab` offers results from our specially tracked sites aggregated by media types `Traditional`, `Independent`, and `Blogs-Social`. The chart is present per crisis and uses the monthly data from Google API. As with other Tabs in `Timeline`, changes in coverage over time can be easily understood. Additionally, as with the following Tab, `Storypoints` (represented as Triangles on the chart) help anchor the site within the context of critical events over the a crisis lifespan.
* Finally for this page, the `Source` Tab presents results from our specially tracked sites and optionally all Google, per crisis using the monthly data from Google API. Sites can be enabled or disabled to help with scale challenges over the range of coverage.

## Data (~:15, ends NLT 1:45)
WHERE? [on `Data` page]  
NARRATION  
>We want to give a quick look at the `Data` page which offers the primary tables that drive this site, derived from using Google Custom Search API. The varieties of tables are:
* `Baseline Coverage Stats` Tab gives a count of all results (not just crisis) available for each of our specially tracked sites over the time period of a crisis.
* `Country Stats` Tab gives a count of results from each country.
* `Crisis Coverage Stats` Tab gives a count of crisis results.
* `Crisis Sample Results` Tab gives a sampling of available search results over a crisis.

## Conclusion (~:15 ends NLT 2:00)
